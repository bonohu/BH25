	abstract = {Despite decades of pathway database efforts and freely available pathway modeling tools, most researchers publish their biological pathway knowledge as static image figures made with general illustration tools. Prior to the BioHackathon, we had identified 103,009 pathway figures in the literature and performed optical character recognition (OCR) (Pathway Figure OCR (Hanspers et al., 2020). As an initial exploration, we extracted chemical names, disease terms, and human gene names. We knew, however, that many of the pathways represented biological processes and entities specific for plant, microbial and numerous non-model organisms.To expand the pathway analysis environment to non-model organisms whose genomic and functional annotations are not organized in a central public database, we sought to expand the number of organism species included in the Pathway Figure OCR (PFOCR) database. Also, with continuing goal of expanding the use of WikiPathways (Pico et al., 2008) and the practice of modeling pathway information as proper data models, we trained new users of PathVisio (Kutmon et al., 2015) and guided them through the process of publishing at WikiPathways.},

	doi = {10.37044/osf.io/spf3q},
	abstract = {In addition to functional annotation of genes, annotating genes to pathways is important in current molecular biology.
But, pathway diagrams are required to annotate genes to nodes of those.
Therefore, it is important to draw pathway diagrams with assignment to genes and metabolites.
Existing metabolic pathway databases focus on generic pathways, while secondary metabolism is emphasized in organisms producing useful substances.
Moreover they cannot accept third party annotation of those data.
A practical system for pathway analyses is therefore really needed.

Following on from the previous BioHackathon (BH23), we first discussed how to create a database of pathway information in non-model species in a domestic version of the BioHackathon called BH23.9 held in Shirahama, Wakayama, Japan (25-29 September 2023).
We then gave a tutorial on how to write a pathway diagram using PathVisio, which is a free open-source pathway analysis and drawing software which allows drawing, editing, and analyzing biological pathways. 
Finally we tried to establish the conversion system from text data to Graphical Pathway Markup Language (GPML), which is called txt2gpml.
txt2gpml will drastically reduce the time and effort required to create pathway diagrams.

After a stimulus discussion in BH23 and BH23.9, we could clarify the current issues in the pathway analysis for non-model organisms.},

With the core idea of the scientific community developing and curating biological knowledge in pathway models, WikiPathways lowers all barriers for accessing and using its content. Increasingly more content creators, initiatives, projects and tools have started using WikiPathways. Central in this growth and increased use of WikiPathways are the various communities that focus on particular subsets of molecular pathways such as for rare diseases and lipid metabolism. Knowledge from published pathway figures helps prioritize pathway development, using optical character and named entity recognition. We show the growth of WikiPathways over the last three years, highlight the new communities and collaborations of pathway authors and curators, and describe various technologies to connect to external resources and initiatives. The road toward a sustainable, community-driven pathway database goes through integration with other resources such as Wikidata and allowing more use, curation and redistribution of WikiPathways content.},

The pathway information is also represented by the ortholog group tables summarizing orthologous and paralogous gene groups among different organisms. KEGG maintains the GENES database for the gene catalogs of all organisms with complete genomes and selected organisms with partial genomes, which are continuously re-annotated, as well as the LIGAND database for chemical compounds and enzymes. Each gene catalog is associated with the graphical genome map for chromosomal locations that is represented by Java applet. In addition to the data collection efforts, KEGG develops and provides various computational tools, such as for reconstructing biochemical pathways from the complete genome sequence and for predicting gene regulatory networks from the gene expression profiles. The KEGG databases are daily updated and made freely available (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/).},

Here we present the third version of PathVisio with the newest additions and improvements of the application. The core features of PathVisio are pathway drawing, advanced data visualization and pathway statistics. Additionally, PathVisio 3 introduces a new powerful extension systems that allows other developers to contribute additional functionality in form of plugins without changing the core application. PathVisio can be downloaded from http://www.pathvisio.org and in 2014 PathVisio 3 has been downloaded over 5,500 times. There are already more than 15 plugins available in the central plugin repository.

However, life scientists have difficulty utilizing the available data due to its sheer magnitude and complicated access. We have developed a web tool for browsing reference gene expression pattern of mammalian tissues and cell lines measured using different methods, which should facilitate the reuse of the precious data archived in several public databases. The web tool is called Reference Expression dataset (RefEx), and RefEx allows users to search by the gene name, various types of IDs, chromosomal regions in genetic maps, gene family based on InterPro, gene expression patterns, or biological categories based on Gene Ontology. RefEx also provides information about genes with tissue-specific expression, and the relative gene expression values are shown as choropleth maps on 3D human body images from BodyParts3D. Combined with the newly incorporated Functional Annotation of Mammals (FANTOM) dataset, RefEx provides insight regarding the functional interpretation of unfamiliar genes. RefEx is publicly available at http://refex.dbcls.jp/.},

	abstract = {Data accumulation in public databases has resulted in extensive use of meta-analysis, a statistical analysis that combines the results of multiple studies. Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between free radical activity and antioxidant activity, which can be studied in insects by transcriptome analysis. This study aimed to apply a meta-analysis approach to evaluate insect oxidative transcriptomes using publicly available data. We collected oxidative stress response-related RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data for a wide variety of insect species, mainly from public gene expression databases, by manual curation. Only RNA-seq data of Drosophila melanogaster were found and were systematically analyzed using a newly developed RNA-seq analysis workflow for species without a reference genome sequence. The results were evaluated by two metric methods to construct a reference dataset for oxidative stress response studies. Many genes were found to be downregulated under oxidative stress and related to organ system process (GO:0003008) and adherens junction organization (GO:0034332) by gene enrichment analysis. A cross-species analysis was also performed. RNA-seq data of Caenorhabditis elegans were curated, since no RNA-seq data of insect species are currently available in public databases. This method, including the workflow developed, represents a powerful tool for deciphering conserved networks in oxidative stress response.},

While CRISPR-Cas9 has become widely used in academic research, its social implementation has lagged due to unresolved patent disputes and slower progress in gene function analysis. To address this, new approaches bypassing direct gene function analysis are needed, with bioinformatics and next-generation sequencing (NGS) playing crucial roles. NGS is essential for sequencing the genome of target species, but challenges such as data quality, genome heterogeneity, ploidy, and small individual sizes persist. Despite these issues, advancements in sequencing technologies, like PacBio high-fidelity (HiFi) long reads and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), have improved genome sequencing. Bioinformatics contributes to genome editing through off-target prediction and target gene selection, both of which require accurate genome sequence information. In this review, I will give updates on the development of genome editing and bioinformatics technologies with a focus on the rapid progress in genome sequencing.},
